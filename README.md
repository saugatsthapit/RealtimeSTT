# RealtimeSTT

*Easy-to-use, low-latency speech-to-text library for realtime applications*


## About the Project

RealtimeSTT listens to the microphone and transcribes voice into text.  

It's ideal for:

- **Voice Assistants**
- Applications requiring **fast and precise** speech-to-text conversion

### Features

- **Voice Activity Detection**: Automatically detects when you start and stop speaking.
- **Wake Word Activation**: Only starts transcription upon hearing a specific wake word.
- **Realtime Transcription**: Transforms speech to text in real-time.

> **Hint**: *Check out [RealtimeTTS](https://github.com/KoljaB/RealtimeTTS), the output counterpart of this library, for text-to-voice capabilities. Together, they form a powerful realtime audio wrapper around large language models.*


## Tech Stack

This library uses:

- **Voice Activity Detection**
  - [WebRTCVAD](https://github.com/wiseman/py-webrtcvad) for initial voice activity detection.
  - [SileroVAD](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad) for more accurate verification.
- **Speech-To-Text**
  - [Faster_Whisper](https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper) for instant (GPU-accelerated) transcription.
- **Wake Word Detection**
  - [Porcupine](https://github.com/Picovoice/porcupine) for wake word detection.

*These components represent the "industry standard" for cutting-edge applications, providing the most modern and effective foundation for building high-end solutions.*


## Installation

```bash
pip install RealtimeSTT
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies, including a **CPU support only** version of PyTorch.

### GPU Support with CUDA (recommended)

Additional steps are needed for a **GPU-optimized** installation. These steps are recommended for those who require **better performance** and have a compatible NVIDIA GPU.

To use RealtimeSTT with GPU support via CUDA please follow these steps:

1. **Install NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit 11.8**:
    - Visit [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit Archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive).
    - Select version 11.
    - Download and install the software.

2. **Install NVIDIA cuDNN 8.7.0 for CUDA 11.x**:
    - Visit [NVIDIA cuDNN Archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive).
    - Click on "Download cuDNN v8.7.0 (November 28th, 2022), for CUDA 11.x".
    - Download and install the software.

3. **Install PyTorch with CUDA support**:
    ```bash
    pip uninstall torch
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
    ```

**Note**: To check if your NVIDIA GPU supports CUDA, visit the [official CUDA GPUs list](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus).


## Quick Start

Basic usage:

### Manual Recording

Start and stop of recording are manually triggered.

```python
recorder.start()
recorder.stop()
print(recorder.text())
```

### Automatic Recording

Recording based on voice activity detection.

```python
recorder = AudioToTextRecorder()
print(recorder.text())
```  

### Wakewords

Keyword activation before detecting voice. Write the comma-separated list of your desired activation keywords into the wake_words parameter. You can choose wake words from these list: alexa, americano, blueberry, bumblebee, computer, grapefruits, grasshopper, hey google, hey siri, jarvis, ok google, picovoice, porcupine, terminator. 

```python
recorder = AudioToTextRecorder(wake_words="jarvis")

print('Say "Jarvis" then speak.')
print(recorder.text())
```

### Callbacks

You can set callback functions to be executed on different events (see [Configuration](#configuration)) :

```python
def my_start_callback():
    print("Recording started!")

def my_stop_callback():
    print("Recording stopped!")

recorder = AudioToTextRecorder(on_recording_started=my_start_callback,
                               on_recording_finished=my_stop_callback)
```

## Configuration

### Initialization Parameters for `AudioToTextRecorder`

When you initialize the `AudioToTextRecorder` class, you have various options to customize its behavior.

#### General Parameters

- **model** (str, default="tiny"): Model size or path for transcription.
    - Options: 'tiny', 'tiny.en', 'base', 'base.en', 'small', 'small.en', 'medium', 'medium.en', 'large-v1', 'large-v2'.
    - Note: If a size is provided, the model will be downloaded from the Hugging Face Hub.

- **language** (str, default=""): Language code for transcription. If left empty, the model will try to auto-detect the language.

- **on_recording_start**: A callable function triggered when recording starts.

- **on_recording_stop**: A callable function triggered when recording ends.

- **on_transcription_start**: A callable function triggered when transcription starts.

- **spinner** (bool, default=True): Provides a spinner animation text with information about the current recorder state.

- **level** (int, default=logging.WARNING): Logging level.

#### Real-time Transcription Parameters

- **realtime_preview** (bool, default=False): Specifies whether transcription should occur in real-time. If set to True, the audio will also be transcribed as it is recorded.

- **realtime_preview_model** (str, default="tiny"): Specifies the size or path of the machine learning model to be used for real-time transcription.
    - Valid options: 'tiny', 'tiny.en', 'base', 'base.en', 'small', 'small.en', 'medium', 'medium.en', 'large-v1', 'large-v2'.

- **realtime_preview_resolution** (float, default=0.1): Specifies the time interval in seconds after a chunk of audio gets transcribed. Lower values will result in more "real-time" (frequent) transcription updates but may increase computational load.

- **on_realtime_preview**: A callable function triggered during real-time transcription. The function is invoked with the transcribed text as its argument.

#### Voice Activation Parameters

- **silero_sensitivity** (float, default=0.6): Sensitivity for Silero's voice activity detection ranging from 0 (least sensitive) to 1 (most sensitive). Default is 0.6.

- **webrtc_sensitivity** (int, default=3): Sensitivity for the WebRTC Voice Activity Detection engine ranging from 1 (least sensitive) to 3 (most sensitive). Default is 3.

- **post_speech_silence_duration** (float, default=0.2): Duration in seconds of silence that must follow speech before the recording is considered to be completed. This ensures that any brief pauses during speech don't prematurely end the recording.

- **min_gap_between_recordings** (float, default=1.0): Specifies the minimum time interval in seconds that should exist between the end of one recording session and the beginning of another to prevent rapid consecutive recordings.

- **min_length_of_recording** (float, default=1.0): Specifies the minimum duration in seconds that a recording session should last to ensure meaningful audio capture, preventing excessively short or fragmented recordings.

- **pre_recording_buffer_duration** (float, default=0.2): The time span, in seconds, during which audio is buffered prior to formal recording. This helps counterbalancing the latency inherent in speech activity detection, ensuring no initial audio is missed.

- **on_vad_detect_start**: A callable function triggered when the system starts to listen for voice activity.

- **on_vad_detect_stop**: A callable function triggered when the system stops to listen for voice activity.

#### Wake Word Parameters

- **wake_words** (str, default=""): Wake words for initiating the recording. Multiple wake words can be provided as a comma-separated string. Supported wake words are: alexa, americano, blueberry, bumblebee, computer, grapefruits, grasshopper, hey google, hey siri, jarvis, ok google, picovoice, porcupine, terminator

- **wake_words_sensitivity** (float, default=0.6): Sensitivity level for wake word detection (0 for least sensitive, 1 for most sensitive).

- **wake_word_activation_delay** (float, default=0): Duration in seconds after the start of monitoring before the system switches to wake word activation if no voice is initially detected. If set to zero, the system uses wake word activation immediately.

- **wake_word_timeout** (float, default=5): Duration in seconds after a wake word is recognized. If no subsequent voice activity is detected within this window, the system transitions back to an inactive state, awaiting the next wake word or voice activation.

- **on_wakeword_detected**: A callable function triggered when a wake word is detected.

- **on_wakeword_timeout**: A callable function triggered when the system goes back to an inactive state after when no speech was detected after wake word activation.

- **on_wakeword_detection_start**: A callable function triggered when the system starts to listen for wake words

- **on_wakeword_detection_end**: A callable function triggered when stopping to listen for wake words (e.g. because of timeout or wake word detected)
